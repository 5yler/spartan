Setup
=====

Data folder
-----------

Create a symlink from the shared MIT Dropbox `CORL217` folder to `spartan/src/CorlDev/data`.
For example::

    ln -s $HOME/Dropbox/CORL2017 ./data

If Dropbox is hosted on another computer, you can use sshfs to mount the data from the remote computer::

    mkdir -p ./data  # create mount point
    sshfs user@hostname:Dropbox/CORL2017 ./data


Environment
-----------

Source the `setup_environment.sh` file.  This file appends CorlDev/modules
to the `PYTHONPATH` so that Python scripts can import the corl module.
The corl module contains reusable functions and utilities that are used by
the scripts.

ElasticFusion
----

ElasticFusion wants CUDA 7.5.

Grab www.github.com/patmarion/ElasticFusion, and follow build instructions.  Pat's fork of ElasticFusion adds lcm bridge.

Director
--------

Checkout the branch :code:`corl-master` from the repository :code:`github.com/manuelli/director.git`. This will serve as our internal director branch. The idea is that these changes will make their way back to director/master eventually, but that process shouldn't slow down our workflow.

====
Pipeline
====

1. Collect RGBD data
----
In first terminal, :code:`use_spartan` and then launch:

- :code:`kuka_iiwa_procman`
- Ctrl+R on vision-drivers --> openni-driver (unplug-replug if not working)
- Ctrl+R on bot-spy
- Verify that OPENNI_FRAME traffic is coming over lcm

In second terminal, :code:`use_spartan` and then:

- :code:`lcm-logger`
- Ctrl+C when done logging

Your data should now be saved as :code:`lcmlog-*`

2. Run RGBD data through ElasticFusion
----

Navigate to ElasticFusion executable (in :code:`ElasticFusion/GUI/build`) and then run::

	./ElasticFusion -l ~/Desktop/moving-camera.lcmlog  -f | tee moving-camera.lcmlog.mylog
	
Where :code:`~Desktop/moving-camera.lcmlog` is the full path to RGBD lcm data

Note that :code:`-f` option flips the blue/green, which is needed.

Run on the log for some time, then click Pause, then click “Save” to save a .ply file.  The .ply file will take the lcm log filename +.ply.  Close the program (click X in top left of window) and that will save the .posegraph.  NOTE: do not ctrl+C to exit -- this will not save the .posegraph!

3. Convert ElasticFusion .ply output to .vtp
----

First, open the .ply file in Meshlab, and save it (this will convert to an ASCII .ply file)

Next, convert to .vtp using the command::

  directorPython scripts/convertPlyToVtp.py /path/to/data.ply

4. Global Object Pose Fitting
----

We need environment variables in order for the scripts to be able to find the binaries for these global fitting routines. Please fill in the variables like :code:`FGR_BASE_DIR` in :code:`setup_environment.sh` to point to your local binaries. The relevant python file is :code:`module/corl/registration.py`. To run an example::

	drake-visualizer --script scripts/registration/testRegistration.py

Fitting phone using GlobalRegistration tool

1. Launch :code:`kuka_iiwa_app`.
2. open measurement panel and enable.
3. shift + click on center of phone.
4. execute :code:`globalRegistration.testPhoneFit()`. WARNING THIS IS SLOW.

This creates a cropped pointcloud of 8cm around your click point. Then it runs SuperPCS4 algorithm to fit phone mesh to this pointcloud. By default the phone mesh is downsampled.



5. Extract Images from LCM log
----
The class that is used is is :code:`modules/corl/imagecapture.py`. To extract rgb images from the lcm log run::

	directorPython scripts/extractImagesFromLog.py --logFolder logs/moving-camera --bot-config $SPARTAN_SOURCE_DIR/apps/iiwa/iiwaManip.cfg

This will save the images in :code:`data/logFolder`. The original images will be in the form :code:`uid_rbg.png`. Each image also has :code:`uid_utime.txt` which contains the utime associated with that image. Note that it will overwrite anything that is already there.


6. Generate Labeled Images
----

The class that is used to render labeled images is :code:`modules/corl/rendertrainingimages.py`. Usage::

  directorPython scripts/renderTrainingImages.py --bot-config $SPARTAN_SOURCE_DIR/apps/iiwa/iiwaManip.cfg --logFolder logs/moving-camera

Optionally you can pass :code:`--logFolder <logFolder>` on the command line where :code:`<logFolder>` is the path to the lcm log folder relative to the data folder.  For example :code:`--logFolder logs/moving-camera`. This will generate :code:`uid_labels.png` and :code:`uid_color_labels.png` which are the labeled images.

Misc

Director with Corl Modules
-----
There is a standalone app for launching a director with corl modules::

	directorPython scripts/corlApp.py --logFolder logs/moving-camera --bot-config $SPARTAN_SOURCE_DIR/apps/iiwa/iiwaManip.cfg

The :code:`--logFolder` option specifies which logFolder to use relative to Corl data directory.

Visualizing RGBD Data
---------------------

You can launch director with imageviewapp. You need to pass the :code:`-c` flag to director along with the config file::
	
	cds && cd apps/iiwa
	directorPython -m director.imageviewapp -c iiwaManip.cfg --channel OPENNI_FRAME --rgbd --pointcloud
